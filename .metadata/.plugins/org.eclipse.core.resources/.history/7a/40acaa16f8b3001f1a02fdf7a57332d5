//test method is a part of class M7
//test method uses a i and j 
//if we attempting to i then we give compilation error
//and we attempting to j it is final it not change
//eventhough i is not declare as final but it not modify any where it acting as final
//this type of variable is used in local inner class
//compiler asking you want to modify the i anywhere then i can not be used local in inner class
//if i is not modify then we used in outside of the local inner class 
//if we comment the line number10 then it compile successfully 
//otherwise it give compilation error
